# Stayman Problem-Solving Algorithm

Hey there! So, I've put together this algorithm thing that's all about solving problems, especially in the tech world, but honestly, it can help with all sorts of stuff. It's like a roadmap for tackling issues, whether they're tech-related or not.

I came up with this during a workshop for newbie engineers who are eager to sharpen their problem-solving skills. The idea is to show them that problem-solving is a skill you can apply across the board, not just in coding or whatever.

Plus, it's great for experienced engineers who want to mentor the newbies but maybe don't have a structured way to do it. You know, those engineers who are awesome at fixing things but struggle to teach others how to do it.

And let's talk about schools for a sec. They teach us all sorts of stuff, but they don't really teach us how to problem-solve in a systematic way. It's like they're more interested in finding the natural-born problem-solvers instead of helping everyone become better at it. So, I put this together to level the playing field and help out those who need a bit more guidance in the problem-solving department.
