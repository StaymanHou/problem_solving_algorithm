# Problem-Oriented Mindset

Albert Einstein said: “If I had an hour to solve a problem I'd spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.”

Set aside time to evaluate

Result-driven = ROI

# Recursive & Iterative Process

Only by implementing a solution can we validate our grasp of the problem; And we learn more by doing than by simply thinking about a problem.

Big picture & details

Don't get trapped in a rabbit hole and lose the big picture

Don't get fascinated by the absctract stuff and become impractical or idealistic

hypothesis, learn, verify

grow & prune

# Exit condition

Problem solved

Or no longer relevant
