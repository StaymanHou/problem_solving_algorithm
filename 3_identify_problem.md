# Check Domain Knowledge

## Do I understand the problem itself?

e.g. Need to have some idea about Double Entry Bookkeeping before talking about building a bookkeeping system.

## Do I understand the current situation, context, background?

e.g. Biz vs Tech. (Except for cutting-edge tech driven biz). Need to launch something quickly vs build it properly. e.g. AliCloud.

Also refer to Yitang PM.

## Do I know the building blocks potentially required for a solution?

Often time we can't properly define a problem without introducing a certain level of implication in the form of solutions. Think of this as finger pointing to the moon.

# Acquire Domain Knowledge

## I know that I know

easy peasy lemon squeezy

## I don't know that I know

still somewhat ok until you need to teach someone else

## I know that I don't know

### Learn

Learn what? To what extend? Bloom's tax. 1/10/100 principles. (iterative)

It's okay that I just learn enough to solve the problem at hand (Ties with the recursive approach)

Pitfalls: not MECE. Missed a critical component. Missed a better option.

### Try (iterative)

Verify that I've changed from I know I don't know to I know I know

## I don't know that I don't know

Most dangerous

### Research & Benchmark

e.g. Recommender system

### Ask

Give context and background, check the math example in Chapter 2

### Training

### Study (in adjacent fields)

### Feedback / Open Mindedness

### Other factors


No learn is going to be wasted. So don't be afraid of learning
- improve learning skill
- enhance understanding of other matters
- need to learn anyways
- give you more options


# Identify Root Problem

## Something not working as expected

Why? What are the possible causes? How to verify or rule out? Don't jump to fix too quickly.

More in ch 5

## Develop something new

Why? Can we not do it? (Lean) Can we solve another simpler problem?

## Other type

## When to stop?

Usually one or two levels deeper can be enough.

short term vs long term

# Clarify Objectives

## Desired Input and Output

lo-fi, hi-fi, prototype, etc

ROI (1/10)

### solve it to what extend?

2/5/3 principles

## not always need to solve the root problem

## Exceptions

# Deal with the unknown

# conclude

not just think. sometimes needs to take action
